#The Warrior

---
---

In The Warrior you will face off against the villainous Peach Clan to avenge your master's shameful loss at the hands of their Master West (no relation to Kanye). Kick, chop, punch your way through these rascals, deciding at each encounter whether it is better to fight or flee!

With each win you'll add to your health points but each time you flee you'll lose 2!

As you chase down the clan you'll face each clan member at random.

#####But be wary of Master West, Crane Master Sam, Drunken Master Crawford and Jerome (#real_life)...
They will not be as easy as the others...


###How to play

---
To start run the_warrior.rb in your terminal.
You will need to provide your name at the beginning. Don't worry about case sensitivity, we got that covered!

Both you and Peach clan start with 10 health/hit points (hps). Some of the clan will be stronger so watch out!

When you encounter one of the Peaches you'll have to choose between fighting or fleeing.

Fight: You will always attack first and alternate attempts to hit with each other. If your hit lands, then the villain will lose 2-4 hps. If their hit lands, you will lose 1-3 hps. If you win, your health will be restored and you will gain one additional max health point.

Flee: You can choose to flee rather than attack but this will cost you 2 hps. Over time you will weaken considerably if you keep fleeing.

Choose wisely!
